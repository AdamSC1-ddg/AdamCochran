The great design style is inspired by the creation of Jack Callister. Oh, and there are no trackers, pop-ups, alert requests or any of that nonsense. Just good old fashion HTML like your mama used to make! -->

      <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Adam <!-- Scott --> Cochran</strong>.</p>
	    
	    <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
	  
	  <p>I'm a marketing executive, data analyst, professor of information science<!-- teaching information science and SQL -->, angel investor and husband. Currently I reside in <strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>.<!-- It's great because we've got Tim Hortons, free healthcare and more tech talent than Liechtenstein has people!. They have around 37,000 people in case you were wondering. According to Wikipedia they also have a GDP per capita of $98,432 - that's pretty crazy. It's because they boast a pretty hefty financial sector. Did you know they actually have more registered businesses than they do people? 37,000 in case you forgot. --></p>
	  
	  <p>I currently work for <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> where I was the first marketing and business development hire. For the past 4.5 years, my focus here was growth, and now I focus on our strategic partnerships and integrations. <!--They are super rad and respect your privacy. We also have super awesome Instant Answers built by the open source community on DuckDuckHack.com you should check it out! --></p>
	  
	  <p>Previously, I lead marketing at a Bitcoin exchange,<!-- I got into Bitcoin really early and had actually mined a hefty sum, but I thought it was never going anywhere so I sold off some of it and lost the rest on an old hard drive long before I got into the industry professionally. It was pretty devistating! --> consulted in data marketing <!-- data marketing includes a lot of practices that bridge the gap between tech and marketing, including automation, trend analysis, split-testing, lots of fun stuff! --> for major brands like <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>, <a href="http://www.blackberry.com">Blackberry</a> and <a href="www.deere.com">John Deere</a>. I've also worked on speciality projects for groups like the <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com">NASDAQ</a>, <a href="http://www.cibc.com">The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://angellist.com">AngelList</a>, <a href="http://automattic.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://www.chase.com">Chase Bank</a> and taught at or developed courses for educational institutions including <a href="https://wlu.ca/">Wilfrid Laurier University</a>, <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca">McMaster University</a> and <a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca">Conestoga College</a>.</p>

	    <p><strong>Works:</strong></p>
	    
	    <p>I'm fascinated by research on NFTs, decentralized organizations, decentralized authority, the ethics of AI, and decentralized decision making. Basically, any time new technology can solve an ethical, political or economic problem.</p>

<p>I currently produce a cryptocurrency newsletter called <a href="https://coffeeandcoin.substack.com/about?">Coffee&Coin</a> that is a free weekly look at the tech, politics, economics and policy impacting the blockchain space. It's read by thousands of users around the world including top industry figures including executives at <a href="http://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="http://kraken.com">Kraken</a>, <a href="http://enjin.io">Enjin</a> and multiple hedgefunds.</p>
	
<p>On my (rarely updated) <a href="http://www.medium.com/@adamscochran">blog</a>, I write about crypto <!--Fun Fact: I was also a moderator of the /r/Dogecoin community and helped with initiatives like sending the Jamacian Bobsled team to the Sochi Olympics! -->, AI, robotics<!-- I'm fascinated by robotics that automate human capital -->, angel investing<!-- Where I am a novice commited to learning --> and startups<!-- Because I've been at a few, not that I'm an expert by any means!-->. On the rare occassion there may be a historical research piece involving dragons. <!-- It's actually currently a /r/AskHistorians post exploreing where the myth of Dragons comes from - if you're interested: https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3iarqe/do_historians_know_why_we_see_dragon_mythology_in/cufab91/?context=3 --></p>

<p>I also manage major crypto subreddits like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/">/r/Cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/EthFinance/">/r/EthFinance</a> and the newly launched <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/EthFi/">EthFi</a>. Which combined have >1M subscibers and see up to 20M unique MAU.</p>

<p>To help keep the industry safe, I produce <a href="https://github.com/ironcoinext/IronCoin">IronCoin</a> a security extension for Brave Browser and Chrome that blocks phishing domains, puny code attacks, XSS attacks, crypto scams, fake exchanges, fake software and other crypto scams.</p>
